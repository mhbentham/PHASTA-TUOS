MeshSim 6.1 compatibility
MeshSim linux adjustment in Makefile

3/2/2007 JM
MeshSim 6.0 compatibility:
*Read the model separately as handling of attribute
 case changed in API
 case association fails without explicitely setting the
 model to the case	
 default model file names are geom.xmt_txt (PARASOL) 
 or geom.sdm (DISCR); option -G specifies model file name 
 on command line
*functionalities that use mesh data base entity modification are
 put on hold:
 -Periodicity for p>2
 -face_extraction (NSFTAG>=0)		 		
* parasolid now is built into MeshSim
* TO BE DONE: cygwin win compatibility check

make sure the following environment vars are set on cygwin:
export CVSROOT=:pserver:<username>@cvs.scorec.rpi.edu:/export/cvsroot
export DEVROOT='/home/<username>/develop'
export MESHSIM='/users/SCOREC/public/meshSim/latest'
export MESHSIM=`cygpath -w $MESHSIM`

Currently, this environment is set for user 'User' on sole

the meshSim libs have been installed at that very location
and the location of parasolid has been taken care of in the Makefile

The following changes are critical to  code portability to Win:
1) all STL header AHEAD of all other headers
2) using namespace std; required
3) Makefile needs specific paths for libs and includes
4) special care has to be taken when fortran obkjects shall be linked
   (see phAdapt for coding details: LU)

2. Parallel Version gets support for SPEBC
3. LocalInfo extensively revamped.
4. all redundant multiproc loops and data structures ripped off from serial code.
5. tested for compatability with phSolver 1.7.2

3_5_0
split 2 phase NSpre

serial version still needs lot of work to remove redundant stuff
parallel version needs to add support for SPEBC.

3_4_8
makefile changes to accomodate new cvsroot

3_4_7 ( 3/7/2002 )
1. Null model case introduced
2. memory saving drive nearly complete.
3. migrated to meshsim 3.3

3_4_6 ( 2/27/2002 )
1. a whole load of memory tweaks...
   but no other functional changes.

3_4_5 ( 2/8/2002 )

1. problem with meshim parasolid fixed  ( mdb2phasta.cc )
2. small bug introdued by formatting in setPeriodic.cc fixed 

3_4_4 
some source code formatting

3_4_3

Total independence from SCOREC libraries... or total dependence on meshsim :(

3_4_0
Committed and tagged on 5/29/2001
Reversed the changes between 3_3_9 and 3_3_9_1 (the latter
 can serve as a branch point for development and testing
 of those changes)
Fixed a periodicity bug (which involved modifying vs attaching
 data)
Changed the restart option such that it reads C-format files.

3_3_9_1
tagged as 4_0_0 and commited on 5/9/2001
tagged as 3_3_9_1 and committed on 5/28/2001 (4_0_0 tag deleted)
This version has no developmental changes.
This version has been modified to remove the use of PList as a
container. so a simple LinkedList has been introduced.

This version should be completely compatible with AOMD when that
interface is ready. (only minor changes to the Makefile will be needed)

This version compiles with both MeshSim and SCOREC tools but is known
to work only with MeshSim Libraries. 

NewFiles added: F_exists.c F_coord.c
Files removed: R_edges.c return_vertices.cc


3_3_9
tagged and commited on 4/29/2001
This version implements full C-interfce to model and mesh and compiles
with MeshSim libraries. 

***Note***
As of now, this version compiles only with MeshSim. due to lack of
some functions in the scorec C interface. 4/29/01

Files changed. All most all files. (to change headers , include ifdefs etc..)

3_3_8
tagged and commied on 4/22/2001
The surface mesh extraction capability from 3_3_7 has been extended to handle
a list of contiguous modelfaces. 

 * the model can be loaded for this purpose without an atdb file
   using the -d options

 * the -T options takes the number of model faces as the argument and 
   then prompts the user for the face tags
 
 * NSpre quits after extracting the surface mesh of the give list of model
   faces 

3_3_7
tagged and commited on 4/5/2001
Added capability to output an ordered boundary mesh of the given model face.
Also the boundary faces are reordered so that each face has atleast one free
edge when it is encountered in the walk.

*****IMPORTANT****

The face reordering works only for trifaces.( tets )

Files Added : src/face_extraction.cc
Files modified : src/mdb2phasta.cc

3_3_6
tagged and commit on 3/24/2001
Changes in 3_3_5 brought to completion. 
more key phrases standardized 
ncorp is now a part of geombc.dat

3_3_5 
tagged and commited on 3/16/2001

1. Keyphrase based pseudo random access implemented for PHASTA input
   
   all data items are of the format

	keyphrase : skipsize a b c .....
	[BINARY DATA BLOCK]

	skipsize will be the size of the following binary DATA BLOCK following the
	ascii line 

	skipsize will be zero for items which do not have a BINARY DATA BLOCK
	after them

    the key phrases are case and space insensitive. but need to be delimited 
	by a ":" . 

	"#" is the comment character and can start anywhere in the line

2. starting this version, NSpre echos its version when used with the -V option
   and echos the version number and command line arguments and the date and
   time of creation to the outputfiles.

3. All files now have version numbers .. right now everthing is 1.0

4. Compatible interface has been created for PHASTA and should be a part of
   all tags above 1.6.0 , please confirm this by reading the PHASTA changes
   file.

5. BCB is nolonger calculated as a nodal quantity but one value per face is
   calculated at the centroid. same as IBCB so we now restrict the input to
   have only piecewise constant natural boundary conditions.

6. Now byteorder is automatically recognized by reading a predefined magic
   number "362436" and we have done away with all the ifdefs

3_3_3
tagged and commited on 3/5/2001  ( Ya I know , third tag today )

Dynamic model averaging information included in the code 
--> translates to --> sonfath is now a part of NSpre

*** to activate this feature one needs to use -S flag with a numeric argument
    for the number of homogenous directions.

*** Actually this is like a third party module. 
	anybody can plug in their own version of sonfath suitable for their
    geometry by providing an equivalent of sonfath.f

Files Added : sonfath.f :(  fortran back in the game.

No files were removed.

3_3_2 
tagged and commited on 3/5/2001 

produces output for phasta versions 1_6_0 and higher
versions prior to 1.6 absolutely will not work with this NSpre
for older version use tag values upto 3_3_1

Starting this version.. NSpre needs standard library support.

Notable Changes
---------------
1) Topology polynomial order blocking done inside NSpre
2) Format of output files changed to write data blockwise
3) Moved form fortran unformatted data to C binary data.
	now the code expects restartc.inp instead of restart.inp 
	there is a conversion utility available to convert older 
        restarts to new C binary format.

4) code implemented to make binary output contain the byteorder information
   which is later used in other programs to interpret data.
5) End of life for petsc junk
6) Most of the foundation for variable P laid in this version.

Bugs Fixed
----------
1) attachable data tag for axisymmetry changed form "thta" to "teta" to
   avoid memory corruption error

2) change  made to PeriodicBC::getMaster() to avoid error on extremely narrow
   periodic faces.

3) bug fixed in NaturalBC::eval() to avoid suprious x value to be used in 
   evaluation of surfid in case no other NBCs are set on a given face.


Files added :  genblock.cc restart.c mdb2phasta.cc

Files removed: mdb2ensa.cc, createBoundary.c all fortran files. :)
               All petsc remnants CountNeighbours, writeSMSmap

3_3_1 
tagged and commited on 3/5/2001

This tag is to move to the makefile structure using buildutil.
the new makefile will be called NEWmakefile and will stay that way
until we are sure that we don't need the old style Makefile.

*) no developmental changes
*) no bugs fixed 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3_3_0
tagged and commited on 10/24/2000

This is the version truly compatible with 64 bit on sgi and the New compiler
in the SUN

 Notable Changes

 a) BCs are now interpolated correctly for quadratic modes for hexes
    ( EssentialBC.cc)
 b) Scalar flux is now NOT mistakenly written into heat flux
 c) Edge and face flipping restored for periodic BCs , now a new geom2.sms 
	is written out which has the flipped entities in that fashion. 
        it remains to be seen how consistently it produces valid meshes.
 d) Now one can specify an arbitrary mesh file with the -m option.
 e) checking for the existence of mesh and attributes file implemented.
 d) Now NSpre is built in two parts 
       i) NSpre library ( independent of the modeller )
      ii) NSpre Executable (dependent on the modeller )

    by default a shared object libNSpre.so is created and linked in with
    the executable as are the rest of the SCOREC modules.

    if a static linking is desired then specify NOSHARED=1 on the
    command line. This only makes a static archive of the NSpre Library ,
    the rest of the  scorec modules are preferntially grabbed as shared
    objects 
 g) Exact point match is no longer required for Linear to Quadratic
    interpolation. But the interpolation points are still expected to be on
    the edges in "Y" direction.
     
 Important Note: when compiling on an SGI workstation, you have to specify
                 the option  PWD=$PWD on the command line.


3_2_9

InitialCondition.cc was evaluation scalars even if they were specified
through restart file  , This causes failure if they are removed from the GUI
( as they should be )

3_2_8

This version is sgi-64 capable and is comapatible with the model/1.4 series
of libraries

3_2_7

lots of bugs fixed in getData.c R_entities &BDry
Mesh is not being modified to match masters and slaves for periodicity only
a warning message is echoed to screen.


3_2_6
old bug in R_entitiesBdry fixed

3_2_5

Hex Factor removed ( watch out for more comments in this space !)

3_2_4
I don't remember what happened here. : ) 
just some routine bugfix stuff I guess will update as soon as possible 

3_2_3:

a)  zScale goes 3D
b)  NaturalBC fixed for scalars
c)  Restart.inp is read once
d)  Quadratic Soln Sampled from a finer linear mesh
e)  Speed and Memory enhancements
     i) entInfo broken into two the first part of which is thrown away as
        soon as we are done with it, only the local eqn number of any entity
        is remembered which is used in generating connectivity
f) SGI_64 partial changes done.
g) Face co-ordinate extraction for a specified model face. 

 ***) Two new command line flags introduced -T and -I

    -I for doing the linear->Quadratic sampling
       { requires a geoml.sms for the linear mesh }
    -T for specifying the face tag(following the flag)
       for co-ordinate extraction
